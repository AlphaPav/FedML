This is where we have user level files such as dataloaders and examples for running fednlp

We provide some ready made h5 files for some of the datasets. To use those use the following commands after editing the DATA_DIR in the bash files
```
bash data/download_data.sh

bash data/download_partition.sh
```

After downloading the data run the commands given in the READMEs of the corresponding examples folder.
